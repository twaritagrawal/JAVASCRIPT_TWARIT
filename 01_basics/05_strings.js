const name="twarit"
const repoCount=50
console.log(name+repoCount+"value"); //we dont use this syntax nowadays as it is outdated
//output==>twarit50 value
console.log(`hello my name is${name} and my repo count is${repoCount}`);//this is the current way of writing i.e string interpolation by adding placeholder between them
